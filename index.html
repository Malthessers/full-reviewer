                        <p>Many, many years ago, there was no earth or man. There was only the sky. Now, in the sky there were two brothers, Bulan and Adlao. The latter was the older and the stronger. But the former was proud and hated his older brother.</p>
                        <p>One day they had a quarrel. Bulan hurled bad words at Adlao, claimed superiority, and challenged Adlao to a fight. The older brother only laughed at his younger brother. But his laugh was answered by Bulan who bellowed: "You coward, come and fight and I will show you my superiority. If you don't fight, I will kill you."</p>
                        <p>And Bulan suddenly rushed to Adlao without waiting for an answer. Adlao was angered and he was forced to fight his younger brother.</p>
                        <p>And the fight commenced. It was a clash between two strengths. With his dub, Bulan hit Adlao, but Adlao dodged the hit quickly. Then Bulan used his bolo, but again he missed Adlao. It was Adlao's turn to hit. So, with his club he hit with all his might, first the eye of Bulan, then the arm of Bulan which became flat at the might of the stroke. Then with his bolo he cut Bulan's flattened arm. When Bulan's eye was hit and his arm was flattened and cut from his body, he cried with pain. His tears fell on the cut flattened arm.</p>
                        <p>As Bulan foresaw his defeat with only one eye and one arm to fight with, he fled, and he was pursued by Adlao who was very angry and wanted to kill Bulan. And they kept running on and on, chasing each other.</p>
                        <p>Now, the cut flattened arm of Bulan with his tears fell. Down and down it went until it finally settled. The flattened arm of Bulan became the earth, and the tears became the rivers and seas. Time came when two hairs sprang from Bulan's cut arm, and from these two hairs sprang man and woman. Thus, the earth and man came into being.</p>

                    <h4>Summary:</h4>
                    <p>The story follows Victor, an eight-year-old boy whose father is a dock worker. His father gets involved in a labor strike against unfair wages and poor working conditions. The strike escalates into violence, and Victor's father is tragically killed. His mother, unable to cope with the loss, eventually abandons him, leaving him in the care of his uncle, Tio Pedring.</p>
                    <p>Forced to drop out of school, Victor is pushed into the harsh world of child labor as a newsboy. He navigates the dangers of Manila's streets, facing bullying, exploitation, and the reality of survival. He befriends Nacio, a lively and experienced newsboy, who teaches him the tricks of the trade. However, tragedy strikes again when Nacio is killed in a street accident.</p>
                    <p>As Victor continues his struggle, he gradually becomes hardened by the world around him. At first, he resists the rough behavior of other newsboys, refusing to curse, smoke, or engage in their reckless habits. However, after a violent altercation, he finally gives inâ€”accepting a cigarette as a symbol of his complete transformation</p>
                    <p>The story depicts the loss of innocence, showing how Victor, once a hopeful child, is shaped by the harsh realities of the city. It critiques social injustices, child labor, and the cycle of poverty that forces children into lives of hardship and crime.</p>

                    <p>The story follows Dodong, a 17-year-old boy who believes he is ready for adulthood. He decides to marry Teang despite his father's hesitation. Dodong is confident in his choice, feeling that marriage will bring happiness and fulfillment.</p>
                                        <p>However, soon after marriage, reality sets in. Teang becomes pregnant, and Dodong realizes the burden of responsibility that comes with having a family. As the years pass, more children arrive, leaving Teang exhausted and regretful. She wonders if her life would have been different had she married Lucio, an older suitor who remained childless.</p>
                    <p>Dodong, too, begins to question his youthful decision. One night, he steps outside, seeking answers about why life does not fulfill youth's dreams. He realizes that youth is blinded by love and desire, but real life is far more difficult than expected.</p>
                    <p>Years later, Dodong's son, Blas, comes home excited to tell him that he also wishes to marry young. Dodong, now older and wiser, does not want his son to go through the same struggles. However, he feels powerless, knowing that youth will always choose love first and learn the hardships laterâ€”just as he did.</p>
                    <p>The story reflects on the cycle of life and how every generation must learn from its own experiences, rather than from the warnings of others.</p>

                    <h4>How My Brother Leon Brought Home a Wife by Manuel E. Arguilla</h4>
                    <p>Baldo narrates the journey of his brother Leon (Noel) as he brings his city-bred wife, Maria, home to their rural hometown of Nagrebcan, La Union from Manila. Instead of taking the usual route through the Camino Real, Baldo follows their father's instructions and takes them through the Waig, a rough, dry riverbed, as a test of Maria's adaptability to provincial life.</p>
                    <p>Riding on a cart pulled by Labang, their family's bull, Baldo observes Maria's grace and poise despite the unfamiliar, rugged path. She remains cheerful, admiring the countryside and showing deep affection for Leon, calling him "Noel." Her warm demeanor reassures Baldo that she truly loves his brother and is willing to embrace rural life.</p>
                    <p>Upon arriving home, their father quietly evaluates Maria through Baldo's account of the journey. Though he does not explicitly state his approval, Maria's patience and respect suggest that she has passed the test. The story highlights love, acceptance, and the contrast between urban and rural life, with Labang symbolizing the steady, unchanging nature of the countryside. Maria's journey represents not just a physical transition but also her readiness to be part of Leon's world</p>

                    <h4>The Taximan by Catherine Lim</h4>
                    <p>The Taximan is a short story by Catherine Lim that provides insight into Singaporean society through the perspective of a chatty and opinionated taxi driver. The story is narrated by the taximan himself as he shares his views on modern youth, morality, and changing cultural values.</p>
                    <p>The taximan recounts his experiences driving young customers, particularly teenage schoolgirls, around the city. He expresses frustration with the new generation, criticizing their lack of discipline, obsession with money, and preference for Westernized lifestyles. He frequently complains about how these girls lie to their parents, skip school, and visit hotels with older men for money.</p>
                    <p>Despite his disapproval, the taximan admits that he profits from this situation. He earns extra income by driving these girls to their secret destinations, even though he considers their actions immoral. His hypocrisy is revealed when he condemns the behavior but continues to benefit financially from it.</p>
                    <p>Towards the end of the story, his disapproval turns personal when he shares that his own daughter has been caught engaging in similar behavior. This deeply upsets him, exposing his double standardsâ€”while he condemns other girls, he is devastated when the same thing happens in his own family.</p>
